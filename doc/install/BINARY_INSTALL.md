# Install DR from binary

To install DR directly from a binary release, you can simply head to the [releases] section on github,
download the latest binary, copy it to your ***$PATH***, grant it execute permissions (chmod +x),
 and you should be able to start using dr (remember to [configure] the repository!).

[releases]: https://github.com/MarcosCela/dr/releases
[configure]: ../configuration-file.md
